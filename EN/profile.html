    <h2>Impetus</h2>
    <p>I started making CSS when I met tae's CSS. <br>When I first saw her screen, it was not the Krunker I knew. <br>A
      little while later I found out that it was a modification of CSS.<br> Then I did some research and started making
      CSS.<br>
      About 8 months after I started making CSS, I was able to get it verified.<br>I'll always be grateful to tae for
      inspiring me to start making KrunkerCSS.<br> And I will continue to follow her footsteps.
