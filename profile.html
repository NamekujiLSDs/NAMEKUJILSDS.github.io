		<h1>How I got started with CSS</h1>
		<div class="space"></div>
		<p>The reason I started making CSS was because I saw tae's work.</p><br>
		<p>
			Her screens were no longer Krunker, they were full of artistry.</p><br>
		<p>At first, I didn't know what I was doing, but with the help of many people, and I got Verified.</p><br>
		I would like to thank the many members of the CSS community, the many people who have supported my work, and tae
		for getting me started with CSS, both now and in the future.</p><br>
		<p>You can also go to her website if you want.</p><br>
